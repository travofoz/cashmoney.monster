notes
-----
AVGSALARY  -- Gross amount of last paycheck before taxes are taken out.    *****Very important that this is amount of paycheck and not monthly salary. ( you will have to calculate based on their paycheck amount. there should be a hover tool tip or something for these fields too where appropriate [not all of them obviously]
DEBT   --- do you have 10k in unsecured debt (1 or 0); not in the spec but add it.

CUSTGENDER -- this is tricky to collect but i have an idea. technically we are not allowed to collect this for loans, but we might sell the lead as not a loan so its required. what if we collect preferred pronouns and (offered he/him she/her they/them) but he and they = M and she = F

get rid of the reference and other nonsense.
