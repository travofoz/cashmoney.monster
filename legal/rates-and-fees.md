# Rates & Fees

We’ll never charge you a fee to connect you with a lender at CashMoney.Monster. Filling out and submitting your request is completely free. We use the information you provide to search our resources and connect you with a reliable lender. Without complication, you may be able to receive approval for a loan quickly.

**Lenders Determine Rates**

CashMoney.Monster is not a lender. We connect you to reputable lenders and service providers within our network. Each individual lender will determine any interest rate on your loan, and you will have the opportunity to review all rates and fees before accepting an offer.

**Simple Qualifications**

When looking at the terms of your agreement, you may have concerns that the interest rates appear higher than traditional bank loans. Remember, the amount is paid back much more quickly than a regular loan, so the interest isn’t given a chance to ever stack up. We also keep our qualification requirements simple enough to allow almost anyone to qualify, even applicants who would most likely not be approved elsewhere.

**Loan Disclosures**

With the loans our lenders and financial service providers offer, you will always know exactly what to expect before you are under any obligation to actually take out the loan. All the lenders and financial service providers in our network strictly follow the Truth in Lending Act, which means that you’ll receive documentation of every last detail of your loan beforehand. You’ll be able to see all applicable interest rates, possible fees, and all other information on your loan, allowing you to make an informed, responsible borrowing decision without any pressure.

**Truth in Lending**

After you’re approved for your loan, you can discuss the terms in as much detail as you are comfortable with prior to signing. If there are any doubts over your interest rates or repayment terms, there’s no obligation to proceed with the loan. Under the Truth in Lending Act, transparent contractual agreements are required by federal law, which helps protect you against predatory lending. Be sure to read all the fine print, so there are no surprises.

**Pressure Free**

Using an online loan is designed to help you avoid financial hardship, not contribute to it, so only agree to loan terms that are well within your budget constraints. Defaulting on a loan will not help you escape that vicious circle of debt, and that should be your ultimate goal. If you change your mind and decide not to proceed, that’s okay too. You’re welcome to request again at any time in the future.
