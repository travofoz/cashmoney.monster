# Ad Disclosure


We strongly recommend you carefully read this entire page before using our service so you can fully understand our advertising practices. At the very least, please read the short version of this Ad Disclosure directly below.


### **Short Version**


This site offers a free, for-profit, advertiser-supported financial comparison and marketing service. When you submit the form on this site, we send your information to lenders and third-party lender networks that are not lenders to try to connect you with a lender. We and our network partners may also share your contact information with other third-party marketing partners that may offer you other credit-related products or services (eg. debt relief, credit repair or credit monitoring). 


We receive financial compensation from these various partners in exchange for connecting you with them, sharing your information with them and/or marketing their products and services to you. This compensation allows us to offer our service for free to you and make a financial profit. This compensation may impact which providers you are connected with and the placement of ads. You are likely to be connected with the highest bidder(s) or see ads for the highest bidder(s). 


IF YOU ARE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF LENDERS, THIRD-PARTY LENDER NETWORKS AND THEIR SERVICE PROVIDERS PROCESSING YOUR SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION, YOU SHOULD NOT USE OUR SERVICE.  


IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO RECEIVE MULTIPLE MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS FOR BOTH LOANS AND OTHER CREDIT-RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, YOU SHOULD NOT USE OUR SERVICE.


For additional information about our privacy practices, see our [Privacy Policy](https://www.CashMoney.Monster/privacy-policy/ "Privacy Policy").


### **Long Version**(strongly recommended)


#### **We first share your information with the lenders in our network**


When you submit a form on this site, our proprietary loan marketplace processes this information to determine which lenders in our network have expressed interest in offering a loan to consumers like you. We then share all of your information with these lenders so they can decide whether and how much they are willing to pay us to be connected with you. If only one lender is willing to pay us to be connected to you, we connect you with that lender. If more than one lender is willing to pay us to be connected with you, our proprietary algorithm uses a number of variables to determine which lender to connect you with. However, the amount the lender is willing to pay us is likely to be the most important variable impacting which lender we connect you with. 


We do not exercise any control over any lenders and we do not endorse any specific lender.


Most users that are connected with a lender using our service are connected to lenders in our extended network, and not with lenders in our direct network. (Keep reading to learn more about our extended network).


#### **We will likely share your information with non-lender third-party lender networks**


If none of the lenders in our network are willing to pay us to be connected with you, we then share your information with our extended network of non-lender third-party lender networks (“Lender Networks”) to see if any of the lenders in their networks are willing to pay us to be connected with you. These Lender Networks are loan marketing companies that are commonly referred to as “lead aggregators.”


These Lender Networks show your information to the lenders in their network to see if any are willing to pay them (and, indirectly, us) to be connected with you. If only one Lender Network has a lender that is willing to pay to be connected with you, we and the Lender Network connect you with that lender. If more than one Lender Network has a lender in their network that wants to pay to be connected with you, our proprietary algorithm uses a number of variables to determine which Lender Network we will use to connect you with the relevant lender in that network. However, the amount the Lender Network is willing to pay us is likely to be the most important variable impacting which Lender Network’s lender we choose to connect you with. 


Our Lender Networks do not share the identities of their lenders with us, and so we do not know which lender you are connected with if you are connected through a Lender Network. We also do not know which lenders in their network they show your information to. 


We utilize Lender Networks both because they increase the likelihood our users will be connected with a lender, and because they help us make a financial profit from our free-to-consumer service.


#### **Our Lending Partners’ service providers may also process your information**


Many of our lenders and Lender Networks (together “Lending Partners”) use service providers to manage their online consumer acquisition, facilitate their purchasing of internet traffic from websites like ours, verify your identity and information, look up your credit history, or for other reasons related to your loan request. These service providers may receive and process your data on behalf of the Lending Partners they work for. In some cases, we receive compensation from these service providers and not from the lender directly.


#### **You may receive offers for different loan products or loan amounts**


We may connect you with a lender that offers you different loan amounts, loan terms, or rates than those you stated a preference for. If we are able to connect you with a lender, their identity will only be disclosed to you after you have submitted our form. We may redirect you to their site to see more about their loans. They may reach out to you directly by phone, SMS and/or email. You can review their offers and decide whether to take out a loan with them. We highly recommend you compare multiple lenders and offers so you can make an informed decision about your loan. 


#### **We may show you ads for other finance-related products or services**


Right after we have attempted to connect you with a lender, we may also show you ads for lenders and/or other finance-related products or services, such as debt relief, credit repair or credit monitoring. We use some of the information you provide on our form to choose which of these products or services to advertise to you. If you click on these ads, we may share your contact information with these advertisers so they can contact you about their products or services. These advertisers do not see any of the other information you provided on the form, but they may be aware that you submitted a form on this site and so may know what type of loan you were interested in obtaining or whether you were connected with a lender.


We are compensated by these advertisers. How much they pay us impacts which ads we show you and the placement of these ads. We show you these ads both because we think our users may benefit from the advertised products or services and because it helps us make a profit from our free-to-consumer service. 


#### **We may continue to market finance-related products or services to you with the help of third-parties**


When you use our service, you agree to be added to our marketing lists so we can market to you after you are done using our service. We may send you ads or offers for loans and/or other credit-related products or services by email, SMS, phone, postal mail or other methods. We often utilize third-party advertising service providers to conduct this advertising on our behalf. These service providers will receive and process your contact information that’s reasonably necessary to send you ads. They do not receive any of the other information you submit on our form. These service providers may also use their own technical service providers to facilitate the delivery of ads to you, which may necessitate your contact information being shared with these additional service providers. 


We are compensated by these advertisers. How much they pay us impacts which advertiser’s products or services we advertise to you. We advertise these products and services to you both because we think our users may benefit from the advertised products or services and because it helps us make a profit from our free-to-consumer service.


#### **More important information about our service**


This site does not have access to all lenders or all available loan products. You should not assume that any offer you receive using our service is the best available option for you. You should always compare other options and make your own informed decision about the best products or services for your unique situation.
