# Cashmoney.monster Development Plan

## Project Overview
Payday/Personal/Installment loan lead generation website with GulfCoastLeads API integration.

## Git Workflow Strategy

### Branching Strategy
- **master**: Production-ready code only (old school, no BS)
- **feature/{name}**: Individual feature development
- **phase/{number}**: Phase-based development branches
- **hotfix/{issue}**: Critical production fixes

### Commit Message Convention
```
feat: add loan amount selection component
fix: resolve bank routing number validation
docs: update API integration guide
refactor: consolidate form state management
test: add validation unit tests
```

### Merge Strategy
1. Complete feature in branch
2. Verify functionality thoroughly
3. Create meaningful commit groups
4. Merge to phase branch
5. Test phase completion
6. Merge to master only after phase verification
